/***
    title: Container
    section: Layout
    description: Centers an element on the screen at a width of $site-width. Containers should be direct decendants of body/main (any full width element actually) and don't work properly when nested like this. You can also use @include container and pass an optional width;
    example:
        <div class="container bg--white">
            <h1>I'm centered</h1>
            <p>In the middle of the page</p>
        </div>
***/
.container {
	@include container;
}
